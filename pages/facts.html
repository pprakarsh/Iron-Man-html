			<H1>Here are some Cool Facts about Iron Man movie series</H1>
			<ol>
				
				<br><li><strong>Tom Cruise was almost Iron Man<br></strong>It's hard to imagine anybody other than Robert Downey, Jr. as Iron Man, but Tom Cruise was considered for the role. He turned it down because he wasn't pleased with the script. (At one point Quentin Tarantino was interested in directing.)</li>
				<br><li><strong>Iron Man can lift over 100 tons<br></strong>When fully powered, Tony Stark can lift up to 100 tons in the Iron Man suit. Pretty impressive considering that the Hulk's maximum lift (when calm) is 100 tons as well.</li>
				<br><li><strong>Iron Man suit can become reality<br></strong>Lockheed Martin is one of several companies in the process of developing untethered exoskeletons reminiscent of Iron Man's suit. Their Human Universal Load Carrier (HULC), is meant to help soldiers carry loads of up to 200 lbs. at a top speed of 10 MPH for prolonged periods of time.</li>
				<br><li><strong>Tony Stark is based on Howard Hughes<br></strong>According to 'Iron Man' creator Stan Lee, Stark was based on magnate Howard Hughes, who Lee described as "one of the most colorful men of our time. He was an inventor, an adventurer, a multi-billionaire, a ladies' man and finally a nutcase.</li>
				<br><li><strong>JARVIS has not so clever name<br></strong>In Iron Man, JARVIS acts as Tony Stark’s artificial intelligence, helping him navigate the complexities of the suit. You might think the anagram would be something intelligent sounding, but instead, all it stands for is, “Just A Rather Very Intelligent System.”</li>
